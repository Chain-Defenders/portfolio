# What is this?

In this repository, you can find final reports of audits done by the team of ChainDefenders.

## Structure

As you can see they are divided into two folders:

- **contests** - these are reports of the validated findings in a given contest;
- **private audits** - these are reports of the findings on a private engagement that the team took part in.
